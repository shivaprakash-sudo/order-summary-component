## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I thought I could finish this in an hour, but oh boy, was I wrong!. I'm not used to SASS yet, so just getting the hang of that took so much time and also because of my laptop, which is as fast as a tortoise.

Because of this I'm now more comfortable with SASS.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on mixins and custom functions in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Stop using an extension to compile Sass](https://youtu.be/o4cECvhrBo8) - This is Kevin Powell's video on how to compile SASS in different ways. I watched this because I really didn't know how to compile it before, but now I know better ways to compile it.

## Acknowledgments

Of course, I'd like to thank Kevin Powell once again, for being there to help in CSS related things.
